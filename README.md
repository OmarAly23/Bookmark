## *A description of the project:*

  - A book review website where users would be able to register with a unique username, and then log in using the username and password they have registered with. A user can browse book reviews without creating an account but would lose some utilities. A member will have the privilege of adding reviews unlike a normal user. We will use a third-party API (Application Programming Interface) by Goodreads, a cataloging website with a large database of books and reviews, to pull in ratings from an extensive audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews left by our users programmatically via our websiteâ€™s API. 

 

## *Database:*

### *For our database we will at least need three SQL tables:*

  - To keep track of our users. 

  - To keep track of our books. 

  - To keep track of the reviews. 

  - We may however implement more depending on the nature of the project as it progresses over time. 

 

## *Goals:*

  - To induce the sense of readership in users as they browse for books and their reviews, as book reviews are a contributing factor to whether you are going to read the book or not.  
 

## *Site content:*

   - Registration. 

  - User Authentication. 

  - Search. 

  - Book Page. 

  - Review creation.
